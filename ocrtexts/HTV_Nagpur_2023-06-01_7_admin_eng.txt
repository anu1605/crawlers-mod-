School Management can terminate services of
probationer employee without explanation: HC

lM Legal Correspondent

AFULLBench ofthe High Court
here consisting of Justices Sunil
B Shukre, Avinash G Gharote,
and Anil S Kilor, has held that
keeping in mind the Supreme
Court’s decision of the case
Progressive Education Society
v Rajendra ((2008) 3 SCC 310),
power of termination of a pro-
bationer lies with the appoint-
ing authority which is at liber-
ty to terminate the services of
a probationer employee of a
private school ifit findshis per-
formance unsatisfactory dur-
ing the probation period.

The Full Benchanswered five
intricate legal questions in a
Reference relating to MEPS Act
andRulesformulated byaSingle
Judge. Pronouncing the judg-
ment reserved earlier, on
Tuesday, the Full Bench has fur-
therheldthatassessmentofthe
performance hasto bemadeby
the appointing authority itself
and no explanation or reason
for termination is required to
be given, except informing the

employee that his serviceswere
unsatisfactory, unlessit wasstig-
matic.

The writ petition has been
filed by Gramin Yuvak Vikas
Shikshan Mandal’s President
from Buldhana district and the
Head Master of its school.
Through this petition, a ques-
tion was raised to the correct-
nessand legality ofthejudgment
and order passed by the School
Tribunal, Amravati on August
6, 2019, in appeal, thereby
quashing and setting aside the
terminationorderofjuly9,2016
of the respondent Shivnarayan
Datta Raut, with directions to
the petitionersto reinstate him
with back wages.

In answer to the first ques-
tion of the Reference, the High
Court has held that only sub-
Rule (6) of Rule 15 of the
Maharashtra Employees of
Private Schools (Condition of
Services) Rules (MEPS Rules)
applies toanemployee appoint-
ed on probation, when the
Management seeks to take
action under Section 5(3) ofthe

MEPS Act and not the entire
Rule 15 from sub-Rule (1) to (6)
of the MEPS Rules.

According to the High Court
Full Bench, failure to adhere to
the requirement of sub-Rule (3)
and (5) of Rule 15 of the MEPS
Rules will not ‘ipso facto’ viti-
ate an action taken by the
Management under Section
5(3) of the MEPS Act if the
Management satisfies require-
ment of sub-Rule (6) of Rule 15
of the MEPS Rules by ensuring
thatperformance ofanemploy-
ee appointed on probation has
been objectively assessed by the
Head andrecord ofsuch assess-
ment has been maintained.

The High Courthas held that
non-compliance of sub-Rule (5)
of Rule 15 of the MEPS Rules
would not vitiatean orderofter-
mination of service simpliciter
issued by the Management
under Section 5(3) ofthe MPES
Act, as it covers termination of
anemployee appointed onpro-
bation on both the counts, that
is, unsatisfactory workand also
for unsatisfactory behaviour.

As per the law laid down by
the Supreme Court in the deci-
sion of the case Parshotamlal
Dhingra v Union of India (AIR
1958 SC 36), where a person
appointed on probation, ter-
mination of his service during
or at the end of the period of
probation will not ordinarily or
by itself be a punishment
because such employee has no
right to continue to hold such
post, the termination will not
operate as forfeiture of right to
hold such post.

Therefore, it would be suffi-
cientcomplianceon the part of
the Management while acting
under Section 5(3) ofthe MEPS

Act, ifitcomplieswithonlysub-
Rule (6) of Rule 15 of the MEPS
Rules, Further, as the principles
of natural justice do not apply
to the probationer unless ter-
mination is stigmatic, issuance
ofnotice/warningsforunsatis-
factoryworktosuch an employ-
eeappointed onprobationisnot
contemplated underthe MEPS
Act or Rules.

‘Afteranswering the questions
of law, as formulated by the
Single Judge for Reference, the
Full Bench has directed the
court's Registryto place the case
before the Single Judge con-
cerned for disposal, in accor-
dance with law.

Advocates M M Agnihotri,
Mayank Agnihotri, P L Sagdeo,
and S Z Quazi appeared for the
petitioners. Advocates Radhika
Bajaj and A D Mohgaonkar
(Shivnarayan Raut), Additional
GP Ketki Joshi (Project Officer,

Project, Akola), Advocates Uday

respondents.
