‘The issuance of show cause

front, OCW also could not
achieve the desired reduction
in losses.

As per officials of NMC, the
OCW was tasked with bring-

this means it was Breach of

herself saying she was busy

0f 75, only 7 Vande Mataram clinics functional in city

W Nagpur gets 113
Balasaheb Thackeray
memorial Health and
Wellness Centres to
be run by
Government

M By Vikas Vaidya

THE Nagpur Municipal
Corporation (NMC) opened
thefirstVande Mataram Public
Health Centre at Bhiwsenkhori
inDabhain2021. Itwas thefirst
of 75 such clinics announced
by the then Mayor
Dayashankar Tiwari. The proj-
ectwas proposed under Azadi
ka Amrit Mahotsav to com-
memorate 75 years of India’s
Independence. Of the 75 clin-
ics, only 7 are functional while
threeawaittheirinauguration.
The project failed to gain
momentum as the then

Mahavikas Aghadi
Government provided little
support to it.

Meanwhile, the present
Shinde-Fadnavis Government
has announced Balasaheb
Thackeray memorial Health
and Wellness Centres (HWCs)
to be run by State itself.
Total 113 such clinics,

for 20 FWCs.

Vande Mataram
clinics are to be run
by non governmental
organisations ~ (NGOs)
while HWCs are to be man-
aged bythe State Government.

The civic body had identi-
fied locations for all 75 Vande
Mataram_clinics across 10
zones. The centres were
plannednearcommunityhalls
oratlocations needingprimary

health care services.

NMC was to provide infra-

structurewhilethe health cen-
tres were to run with the help
of NGOs. Providing primary
medical health services at a
nominal fee of Rs 10 was the
responsibility of NGOs.
For the project, NMC
had received around
150 oxygen concen-
trators from differ-
ent NGOs.

According to Dr
NarendraBahirwar,
HealthOfficer, NMC,
‘the scheme received
poor response from
NGOs as only 7 organisations
showed interest.

Former Mayor Dayashankar
Tiwari told ‘The Hitavada,
“Sevensuch clinics have start-
ed and are fully functional.
Three more will be inangurat-
ed soon. With HWCs

announcement, the places
allocated for Vande Mataram
will be given for the new proj-
ect”

“HWCs will not have any
involvement of private party
0rNGO. Theywillbe runby the
Government. From providing
space, infrastructure, doctors,
paramedicalstaff, equipment,
medicines; all will be looked
afterbyGovernment. Now, the
idea of HWCs will work in an
effective manner. We have
received funds for 20 such
HWCs and we are awaiting
funds for 93 more clinics,”
Tiwari added.

Every citizen will get timely
health care services at afford-
able prices. This is a good step
taken by Maharashtra
Government, pointed out Dr
Vandana Kate, President of
Indian Medical Association,
Nagpur branch.
